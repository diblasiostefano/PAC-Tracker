# PAC-Tracker
This project stems from my real ETF savings plan: I built in Python a customizable tool to simulate monthly investments, track capital vs market value, and compute key metrics (XIRR, CAGR, Sharpe, drawdown). It merges my passion for asset management with programming, turning finance into clear, practical insights.
