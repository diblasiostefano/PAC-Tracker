# PAC-Tracker
**Idea**:
The project stems from my personal experience: for the past two years I have been carrying out a savings plan (PAC) on ETFs and I felt the need to monitor it independently, going beyond the standard dashboards offered by brokers and apps such as Trade Republic or Revolut.

**Objective**:
The goal was to build, in Python, a simple yet complete tool capable of simulating monthly PAC purchases, comparing the evolution of invested capital with current market value, and calculating key performance and risk metrics — such as XIRR, CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown. The results are presented in structured tables with clear explanations, making them understandable even for those taking their first steps into investing.

**Usefulness**:
The aim is not to replace existing applications, but to provide a more customizable and experimentation-friendly tool: it is useful as a support for financial education, allows users to “look inside” how a PAC really works, and can be adapted to different ETFs, fee structures, or even alternative strategies.

**Personal Value**:
This project also represents a building block in my journey: it combines my passion for asset management with my determination to grow as a programmer and analyst. It enables me to apply technical tools to a real and concrete case, showcasing my ability to integrate finance, data, and technology, while at the same time making complex concepts accessible and clear.
